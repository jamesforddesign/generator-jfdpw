# generator-jfdpw
> A Yeoman Generator which will create everything you need to start a ProcessWire project

## Installation

Yeoman requires Node and NPM. So first check if you have them installed by running the following in your terminal.
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If you get a version number to both of those, you have node.js and NPM installed. If not, head over to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions there.

Next, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-jfdpw using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-jfdpw
```

Then generate your new project, create a repo in the JFD GitHub account. Clone it to your local machine and then run the following terminal command in that folder

```bash
yo jfdpw
```

Now go ahead and build out your front end using Stalfos (Documentation [here](https://stalfos.io/)).

To install ProcessWire, point MAMP at the website folder. Goto your defined address (eg. bob.websitename/processwire) in your browser and install ProcessWire from the Website folder, using "JFD Base" as your installation profile.
